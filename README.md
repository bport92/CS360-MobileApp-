# CS360-MobileApp-

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  This app was meant to allow users to add, delete and eit their weight. This app was designed to have notifications SMS permissions that would send teh user info about their progress. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  We needed a login for the user and teh ability to create an account. For useability, we created a recycler screen that would have the data teh user entered stored and we created an add and delete button for the user. This app is clean and this app is best practice. It gives the user a very basic straight forward UI. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  In the future I would study harder and come up with better plans and time managment. This is the part I struggled the most with, this part really let me donw. In order to create and app that was somewhat funtioning and useful, I had to take the time to collaborate with other students and implement otehr ideas, even at that point the coding is not great and is a work in progess. I have learned a lot from this class and I wont allow myself to get behind again! 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  With the help of anotehr student we added permission testing, seting a goal weight and a phonenumber to test the premission would funtion correctly. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  In the coding. I really struggling learning android studios and time managment. IN the developmen process I had to learn a lot in what felt like a very little amount of time and I believe that wil come in handy in the future courses.
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  IN teh UI design. At first I was horrible, I was no good but as it went on I found that to be the most exciting part to customize and desgin a UI. However the most accomplishing feeling is code that runs right and functions easily. That I did not master.
